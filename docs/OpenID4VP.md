# OpenID4VP - Online Sharing

This library enables consumer applications (mobile wallet) to share users Verifiable Credentials with
Verifiers who request them online. It adheres to the OpenID4VP [specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html) which outlines the standards for
requesting and presenting Verifiable Credentials.

### Specifications supported
- The implementation follows OpenID for Verifiable Presentations - draft 21. [Specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html).
- Below are the fields we expect in the authorization request,
    * client_id
    * presentation_definition
    * response_type
    * response_mode
    * nonce
    * state
    * response_uri
    * client_metadata (Optional)
- Request Uri is not supported as of now.
- client_id_scheme is not mandatory. By default, we are validating the client based on pre-registered client id scheme, if passed as part of the authorization request it is ignored.
- Same device flow is not supported, Hence redirect_uri is not supported in the authorization request. If passed as part of the authorization request it is ignored.
- VC format supported is Ldp Vc as of now.

**Note** : The pre-registered client id scheme validation can be toggled on/off based on the optional boolean which you can pass to the authenticateVerifier methods shouldValidateClient parameter. This is false by default.

## Functionalities
- Decode and parse the Verifier's encoded Authorization Request received from the Wallet.
- Authenticates the Verifier using the received clientId and returns the valid Presentation Definition to the Wallet.
- Receives the list of verifiable credentials(VC's) from the Wallet which are selected by the end user based on the credentials requested as part of Verifier Authorization request.
- Constructs the verifiable presentation and send it to wallet for generating Json Web Signature (JWS).
- Receives the signed Verifiable presentation and sends a POST request with generated vp_token and presentation_submission to the Verifier response_uri endpoint.
