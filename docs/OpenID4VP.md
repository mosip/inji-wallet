# OpenID4VP - Online Sharing

The Inji Wallet supports OpenID4VP specification draft 21 and this document provides a comprehensive overview of the process of sending a Verifiable Presentation to Verifiers who request them online. It adheres to the OpenID4VP [specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html) which outlines the standards for
requesting and presenting Verifiable Credentials.

## Overview

- The implementation follows OpenID for Verifiable Presentations - draft 21. [Specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html).

- Below are the fields we expect in the Authorization Request:

  - client_id
  - client_id_scheme (Optional | Default value : pre-registered)
  - presentation_definition/presentation_definition_uri
  - response_type
  - response_mode
  - nonce (Optional)
  - state
  - response_uri
  - client_metadata (Optional)

  **Note** : **_request_uri_** is also supported as part of this version.

  The specification also allows the Verifier to send Authorizaton Request by reference. It uses the paramters `request_uri` and `request_uri_method` (Optional) to send the authorization request as a URL reference. This can help reduce the size of the QR code and improve security by not exposing sensitive information.

  - When request_uri is passed as part of the authorization request parameters, below are the expected fields:

    - client_id
    - client_id_scheme
    - request_uri
    - request_uri_method (Optional | Default value : get)

    participant Verifier
    participant Inji_Wallet as Inji Wallet (Mobile App)
    participant User

    Verifier->>User: 1. Display Authorization Request as QR Code
    User-->>Verifier: 2. Scan QR Code via Inji Wallet
    Inji_Wallet->>Inji_Wallet: 3. Extract parameters from QR Code and<br/> validate the parameters
    Inji_Wallet->>Verifier: 4. Send request to request_uri
    Verifier->>Inji_Wallet: 5. Return Authorization Request Object
  ```

The implementation of this feature involves the following steps:

1. The Verifier displays the Authorization Request to the End-User as a QR Code with parameters like `client_id`, `request_uri` and optionally `request_uri_method`, `client_id_scheme`.
2. The Wallet scans the QR Code and extracts the parameters and validates the parameters in the request.
   - In case of `client_id_scheme` being `pre_registered`, the Wallet also checks if the `client_id` and `request_uri` is available with its trusted Verifiers list for privacy considerations.
   - For other schemes, the usual validation is done based on the `client_id_scheme` and the `client_id` value.
3. The Wallet then sends a request to the Verifier's `request_uri` value that is provided in the QR Code.
4. The Verifier processes the request and returns the Authorization request object either as jwt / json.
5. Once the Wallet receives the Authorization Request Object, it extracts the object and first validates the request by performing the following checks
   - The `client_id` and `client_id_scheme` values in the Authorization Request (QR code parameters) and Authorization Request Object (`request_uri` response) are identical, if not the process is terminated
6. After this extraction and initial check, the Wallet then proceeds with the next steps of validation and processing as per the `client_id_scheme`.

**Note** : The pre-registered client id scheme validation can be toggled on/off based on the optional boolean which you can pass to the authenticateVerifier method's shouldValidateClient parameter. This is false by default.

## Client Id Scheme Supported

- Below are the supported Client Id Scheme by the library:

  - **pre-registered** : This client id scheme suggests that the verifier is already registered with the wallet and the trust is already established

  - **redirect-uri**: When the Client Identifier Scheme is `redirect_uri`, it specifies that the client id is Verifier's Response URI . In this case, the Authorization Request must not be signed

  - **did** : When the Client Identifier Scheme is `did`(Decentralized Identifier), cleint id must follow the `did:` URI format without additional prefixes. The request must be signed with a private key linked to the DID, and the corresponding public key must be retrieved from the DID Document via DID Resolution. The specific key used must be identified using the kid in the JOSE header. All other Verifier metadata must be provided through the client_metadata parameter.

## Verifiable Credential Format Supported for Sharing:

- ldp_vc

## Functionalities

##### Authorization Request handling:

- The Verifier will generate a QR code with authorization request.
- Wallet scans the QR code to get the Authorization request and sends the authorization request to the library along with the trusted verifiers and boolean to validate the client.
- Library decodes and parse the Verifier's encoded Authorization Request received from the Wallet.
  <br>**Note** : When request_uri is present in the request, the actual authorization request is retrieved by making a request to the request_uri.
- Authenticates the Verifier based on the client id scheme in the Authorization request and return the valid Authorization request to the wallet.
  <br>**Note** : Only when the client id scheme is pre-registered the validation can be toggled on/off based on the boolean.

##### Credential selection and sending response:

- Wallet reads the authorization request and sends the list of matching verifiable credentials to the library.
- Library receives the list of verifiable credentials(VC's) from the Wallet which are selected by the end user based on the credentials requested.
- Constructs the verifiable presentation and send it to wallet for generating Json Web Signature (JWS).
- Wallet signs the verifiable presentation and sends the JWS along with the details to the library.
- Library receives the signed Verifiable presentation and sends a POST request with generated vp_token and presentation_submission to the Verifier response_uri endpoint.
